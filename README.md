# ID the Athlete

A daily deduction game where you identify a mystery ATP player using
stat-based clues — Wordle's daily format and shareable results, with a
Guess Who?-style comparison mechanic.

Tennis is the first sport available, presented as "ID the Tennis Player."
More sports will be added in the future.

## Status

The .NET 10 upgrade, the AI trivia feature (short blurb about the mystery
player shown on game over), the retro/stadium theme system, and the
guesses-table UI refinements (numbered badges, pill-shaped match/miss
cells, row striping) are all implemented and merged. `dotnet build`
(backend) and `npm run build` (frontend) have been verified to pass
cleanly.

## Features

- **Daily puzzle** — one shared mystery player per day, no repeats for 14 days
- **Practice modes** — Easy / Medium / Hard, unlimited plays, difficulty
  scoped to different eras of the player pool (current stars → 2005-2015
  golden era → pre-2005 legends)
- **Shareable results** — Wordle-style emoji grid via the Web Share API /
  clipboard, no social media API integration required
- **Generic, sport-agnostic schema** — tennis is fully playable standalone
  today; the data model (Sport → Player → Attribute → PlayerAttributeValue)
  is designed so additional sports could be added later as data, not code

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL (via Docker or a local install)

### 1. Start PostgreSQL

Easiest via Docker:
```bash
docker compose up -d postgres
```
Or point `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection` in `appsettings.json` at your
own local Postgres instance.

### 2. Set up the database (EF Core migrations)

Migrations are already committed to the repo (`Migrations/`), so a fresh
clone just needs to apply them:
```bash
cd backend/TennisGuessr.Api
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef   # if you don't have it already
dotnet ef database update
```
The app also calls `db.Database.Migrate()` on startup, so the schema stays
in sync automatically after that. The 20-player sample dataset seeds
itself automatically on first run (see `Data/DataSeeder.cs`).

Only run `dotnet ef migrations add <Name>` if you're introducing new
schema changes going forward — it's not needed for initial setup.

### 3. (Optional) Enable AI trivia blurbs

On game over, the app can show a short AI-generated trivia blurb about the
mystery player. This is optional — without a key configured, the game works
exactly the same, just without the blurb. Set your Anthropic API key via
`dotnet user-secrets` rather than committing it to `appsettings.json`:
```bash
cd backend/TennisGuessr.Api
dotnet user-secrets init
dotnet user-secrets set "Anthropic:ApiKey" "sk-ant-..."
```

### 4. Run the backend
```bash
dotnet run
```
API will be available at `http://localhost:5080`, with interactive OpenAPI
docs (via Scalar) at `http://localhost:5080/scalar/v1`.

### 5. Run the frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
App will be available at `http://localhost:5174`.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/sports/tennis/players` — full player pool (for guess autocomplete)
- `POST /api/sports/tennis/game/start?difficulty=easy|medium|hard` — start a practice game, returns a `sessionId`
- `POST /api/sports/tennis/game/guess?guessNumber=N` — submit a guess, returns per-attribute clue feedback

## Theme System

The app ships with two visual themes — **retro** and **stadium** —
controlled by a single row in the `AppSettings` table (`Key` =
`"ActiveTheme"`; the seeded default is `"retro"`). The frontend reads the
active theme from `GET /api/settings/theme` on load and applies it via a
`data-theme` attribute on the document root, which the CSS variables in
`frontend/src/styles/themes.css` key off of.

To switch themes, update that row directly against the running Postgres
container:
```bash
docker exec tennis-guesser-postgres-1 psql -U tennisguessr -d tennisguessr \
  -c "UPDATE \"AppSettings\" SET \"Value\" = 'stadium' WHERE \"Key\" = 'ActiveTheme';"
```
Swap `'stadium'` for `'retro'` to switch back. Refresh the frontend to see
the change take effect.

## Notes on the dataset

The current dataset is a **20-player sample** (mix of current stars,
2005–2015 era, and pre-2005 legends) meant to prove the game end-to-end.
The full design targets 200 players (~110 current / ~60 2005–2015 / ~30
legends, career-high ranking ≤125) — expanding `DataSeeder.cs` with more
entries is the main remaining step to reach that.

Player stats (Grand Slam counts, titles, etc.) are accurate as of mid-2026
but will drift for active players over time — treat this as a dataset that
needs periodic manual refreshes, not a live feed.
